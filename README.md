## Project Relevance
  The aim of this project is to be as modular as possible in design to conform with the goals of the course in general. Best practices will be encouraged, such as extensive testing and CI/CD methodology. Ideally, the project will be easy to extend with new feature that can be plugged in as developer time allows and as requested by users. The multiple layers of the software allow for design at all levels, from a frontend website for users to run in a browser, to a backend which interacts with a database and does calculations. This will allow for learning new languages and tools, such as Go, Javascript, and Docker.
